## ⚙️ System Overview

This project combines embedded programming, networking, and a web-based user interface into a fully self-contained IoT system.

### 🔌 Key Features

- ESP32 Web Server with REST API (`/on`, `/off`, `/brightness`)
- SPIFFS file system for hosting frontend files
- Automatic file serving with correct MIME types
- WiFiManager with Captive Portal for easy WiFi setup
- mDNS support (`http://controlLED.local`)

### 💡 Hardware Control

- Control 3 LEDs via GPIO (26, 25, 33)
- PWM brightness control using ESP32 LEDC
- Real-time LED state management

### 🌐 System Capabilities

- Fully self-hosted web interface on ESP32
- Real-time interaction between UI and hardware
- No external server required
